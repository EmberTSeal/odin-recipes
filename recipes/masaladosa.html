    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>While masala dosa is a famous snack most popular in South India, these tasty stuffed crepes are enjoyed in North
        India as well and can be found on menus throughout the world.</p>
    <p>Masala dosa are crispy, soft, savory and healthy crepes made with a rice and lentil batter. The dosa are
        gluten-free and dairy-free, with a sturdy yet soft texture that is great for holding a hearty homemade potato
        filling.</p>
    <p>To make the batter, lentils and rice are soaked for several hours and then blended together. This makes a creamy
        and smooth batter. This rice and lentil batter is fermented overnight to create just the right tangy flavor and
        tender, light crepes.</p>
    <p>Dosa Batter is quickly cooked like a thin pancake on a hot griddle, with your choice of oil or butter or ghee.
        The crepe is then filled with a spiced potato and onion filling, and served with Sambar and Coconut Chutney.</p>
