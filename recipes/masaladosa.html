    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>While masala dosa is a famous snack most popular in South India, these tasty stuffed crepes are enjoyed in North
        India as well and can be found on menus throughout the world.</p>
    <p>Masala dosa are crispy, soft, savory and healthy crepes made with a rice and lentil batter. The dosa are
        gluten-free and dairy-free, with a sturdy yet soft texture that is great for holding a hearty homemade potato
        filling.</p>
    <p>To make the batter, lentils and rice are soaked for several hours and then blended together. This makes a creamy
        and smooth batter. This rice and lentil batter is fermented overnight to create just the right tangy flavor and
        tender, light crepes.</p>
    <p>Dosa Batter is quickly cooked like a thin pancake on a hot griddle, with your choice of oil or butter or ghee.
        The crepe is then filled with a spiced potato and onion filling, and served with Sambar and Coconut Chutney.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Soaking Rice and Lentils</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First take all the ingredients in bowls. Take rice and flattened rice in separate bowls. Take the urad dal, chana dal and fenugreek seeds in one bowl.</li>
        <li>Rinse the urad dal, chana dal and fenugreek seeds a couple of times. Then soak them in 1 cup water for 4 to 5 hours.</li>
        <li>Rinse the rice a couple of times and keep aside.</li>
        <li>Rinse flattened rice once or twice and then add to the rice.</li>
        <li>Pour 2 cups water. Stir and soak both rice and flattened rice together for 4 to 5 hours.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Making Batter</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Before grinding, strain the water from the soaked lentils and keep it for grinding urad dal. </li>
        <li>Add the lentils in the grinder jar. Also add ½ cup of the soaked and strained water to the dal. You can even use fresh water while grinding.</li>
        <li>Grind the urad dal, chana dal and fenugreek seeds till you get a batter which is light and fluffy. The urad dal has to be ground really well, so that the batter ferments well.</li>
        <li>Remove the batter in a bowl or pan with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Strain the rice well. Then in the same grinder, add the soaked rice and 1 cup fresh water. You can grind rice in one batch or in two to three batches. This will depend on the size of the grinder jar. To make the batter, I added 1 cup water. You can even add ¾ cup water while grinding. Addition of water will depend on the quality of rice.</li>
        <li>Grind the rice till you get a fine grainy consistency in it. The rice batter should have a fine rava (cream of wheat) like consistency. You can even grind to a smooth batter. </li>
        <li>Now pour the batter in the same pan or bowl containing the urad dal batter.</li>
        <li>Add ½ teaspoon edible rock salt or add as per taste. You can also use sea salt or pink salt.</li>
        <li>Mix the salt very well with the batter. Also mix both the batters very well. Cover and keep aside to ferment for 8 to 9 hours. You can keep batter to ferment for less or more time and this will depend on the temperature conditions in your city.</li>
    </ol>
