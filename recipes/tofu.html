    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tofu is a great source of protein and low in fat. It is so tender too and it soaks up all the flavor of the dish. It is a great blank slate and super versatile. Gochujang is a Korean fermented chili paste, and it's become one of our favourite ways of jazzing up tofu. These tofu cubes are delicious enough to enjoy on their own, but they're an amazing addition to your favourite stir-fry!</p>
