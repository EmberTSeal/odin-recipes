    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tofu is a great source of protein and low in fat. It is so tender too and it soaks up all the flavor of the dish. It is a great blank slate and super versatile. Gochujang is a Korean fermented chili paste, and it's become one of our favourite ways of jazzing up tofu. These tofu cubes are delicious enough to enjoy on their own, but they're an amazing addition to your favourite stir-fry!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Tofu</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>16 oz (450 g) firm tofu, pressed</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp (16 g) cornstarch</li> 
        <li>1 Tbsp (15 mL) vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Tbsp (30 mL) maple syrup </li>
        <li>1 Tbsp (15 mL) gochujang chili paste†</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp (15 mL) sodium-reduced soy sauce </li>
        <li>1 Tbsp (15 mL) rice vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sautéed aromatics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Tbsp (30 mL) vegetable oil</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 medium shallot, diced </li>
        <li>2 red hot chili peppers, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 stalks green onion, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Ensure the tofu is sufficiently pressed before cutting it into 1 cm cubes.</li>
        <li>To a large bowl, add the tofu cubes, cornstarch, oil, salt, and pepper. Gently toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Heat up a large pan over high heat and add the tofu, cooking for about 10 minutes, or until crispy. Try to not disturb the tofu too much, otherwise, it crumbles. Give it a toss only every couple of minutes, so that it cooks evenly on all sides.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the sauce by mixing the maple syrup, gochujang, soy sauce, and vinegar in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>When the tofu is crisped to your liking, transfer it to a plate. Return the same pan to the heat, and add the vegetable oil. When hot, add the garlic, shallot, chilis, and green onion all at once. Sauté for 4 - 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium-high and add the sauce, cooking for another 4 - 5 minutes or until the sauce becomes sticky.</li>
        <li>Add the tofu to the pan, and stir to coat. Garnish, serve, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
