    <h3>Preparation for Chicken Manchurian</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix chicken with soya sauce, salt, ginger garlic paste, red chili powder (optional) and pepper powder.</li>
        <li>Add egg white and flour. Mix well. Set aside for at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>If you have used chicken cubes then skip this step. If you have used the mince divide the mixture to 12 portions. Make balls. If you don't get round balls, that's just fine.</li>
        <li>Heat oil until hot enough to fry. Test by sliding a small portion of the batter to the hot oil. It has to rise without browning. This is the right temperature.</li>
        <li>Deep fry chicken on a medium flame until golden and crisp. When the chicken is done cooking bubbles will begin to reduce. Remove the fried chicken to a kitchen towel. Please make sure the chicken is cooked completely inside before you add it to the sauce.</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Stir in the corn flour with 3 tbsp water in a small bowl. To another small bowl, add vinegar,soya sauce, tomato sauce (optional) and red chilli sauce. Mix all of these and set aside.</li>
        <li>Transfer the oil to a bowl and retain only half a tbsp. Fry ginger garlic until aromatic. Fry onions or scallion whites until transparent.</li>
        <li>Add bell peppers and fry for 2 minutes. Pour the sauces.</li>
        <li>When they begin to bubble, Stir the corn flour mixture and pour it along with 1 cup water or stock.</li>
        <li>The sauce begins to bubble and thickens. Taste the sauce and add in more salt or any sauces you desire. Turn off the heat. Then add fried chicken and spring onions.</li>
        <li>Stir and coat the chicken with the sauces. If you have made to chicken balls then cook for 2 mins.</li>
